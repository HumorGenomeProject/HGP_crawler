AskReddit
 thread, Reddit users shared the most common 
household products that go bad
 that no one usually thinks to check.

"I've opened up so many of those little squares only to find them dry as a regular tissue." -

Child car seats should be replaced every six to 10 years.
"The plastics and foam deteriorate over time and no longer protect the child. I've seen people keep them for years in their garage. They're actually stamped with a date." -

These seats will typically stay okay for 
six to 10 years
3. Fire extinguishers

You never want your fire extinguisher to go bad.
"Some time in between 5-15 years for them to be replaced. You should try to have them serviced annually. You should check the gauge monthly." -

4. Sunscreen

Sunscreen is really only good for a season.
"Every single time I have used the previous year's sunscreen on my children they have completely broken out in a horrible rash. Like, you-need-to-be-seen-TODAY type rash. It was the second time this happened that the pediatrician told me he sees this every year, and to get new sunscreen. This is why I also don't casually borrow sunscreen from family members at our beach to use. I can't guarantee it's new, and it's not worth the doctor visit." -

5. Receipts

Copying your receipts is a good idea.
"Once had a good guy employee of Auto Zone recommend making a photocopy of the receipt for a new car battery. He said he knew the ink fades much faster than the replacement warranty would last." -

If you'll need the receipt anytime in the next year, it's worth making or scanning a copy for safe keeping.
6. Makeup

Throw out all of your old makeup.
"Makeup products trap a lot of bacteria when you dip something back into its casing or just from being exposed to the air while someone is applying it. It can cause a lot of breakouts, or even inflame your eye, since the majority of everyday makeup is used on your eyes. The harsh reality is that most makeup products should be thrown out at least every 6 months." - 
MymlanOhlin
Most makeup products should be replaced between three and six months -

Bleach loses its effectiveness over time.
"The sodium hypochlorite in liquid bleach literally turns into salt water over time." -

Replace your bleach 
every 12 months

10. Flour

Old flour that hasn't been kept in an airtight container may contain weevils.
"Someone else has already mentioned flour, which should be kept in a sealed airtight container to avoid getting weevils, but some flours (other than wheat) need to be refrigerated. Primarily corn meal and almond flour, as the oils in them can go rancid. And some oils (like walnut oil) need to be kept in the fridge for the same reason. If you have specialty flour and oil, the packaging will tell you how to store it, but this is something that many people don't know to look for." -

11. HVAC filter

Make sure your air is always clean.
"Your heating/cooling unit in the garage has an air filter to clean your air before bringing it into the house. You should change it every year, but most people don't even know it exists. It's really easy though - go to the unit, there should be a latched door on it, open it up, and you can see the filter. Then, go to the store and buy the same size, put the new one in, chuck the old one out. Only costs like ten bucks." -

12. Fire and carbon monoxide alarms/detectors
It's best to replace these every 10 years or so.
"Not just the batteries. Older smoke/fire/CO detectors don't work nearly as well as newer ones. You don't need the super expensive ones, but I wouldn't buy the cheapest ones either." - 
Edward_Scout
All smoke alarms should be replaced after 10 years, 
according to the National Fire Protection Assocation
13. Helmets

Don't just leave your old helmets in the garage - replace them.
"Most manufacturers recommend you replace one every 3-5 years; or after a serious trauma" -

14. Power Strips

Power strips are the leading cause of electrical fires in the home.
"They go bad after about 7 years and are one of the most likely household items to cause an electrical fire." -

15. Batteries

Batteries go bad over time.
When left in storage for long periods of time can corrode, start to leak acid and ruin expensive electronics. I had an Original Gameboy in mint condition ruined by old batteries." - 
BipolarBears87
Don't simply throw these in the trash - after your batteries have corroded or have gone bad, it's best to take them to a 
household hazardous waste site
16. Perfume

Perfume doesn't smell pretty forever.
"The essential oils denature and the scent changes. This is the reason behind the 'old lady perfume' smell. They keep bottles for years and don't notice the gradual change. About 2-3 years is the practical max. If you haven't finished the bottle by then, toss it." -

17. Rubber bands

Rubber bands eventually lose their elasticity.
"Rubber bands go brittle after around 1o-15 years." -
