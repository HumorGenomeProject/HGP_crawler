         Antitrust experts refer to horizontal market power in the context of a merger of companies that have substitutable or directly competing products -- the standard case for regulators to intervene.
        </p>
        <span id="midArticle_3">
        </span>
        <p>
         Other concerns could be about vertical market power, when a company merges with a supplier or with a company that refines or distributes its products, or conglomerate market power, which applies to a tie-up between companies with complementary but not interchangeable products, which is the case in seeds and pesticides.
        </p>
        <span id="midArticle_4">
        </span>
        <p>
         Analysts at Bernstein Research and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in separate research notes on Friday cited Syngenta's top management as saying during a dinner with analysts in London that Syngenta shareholders would bear the risk of a deal getting blocked for non-horizontal antitrust reasons.

         "It's surprising that the break-up fee would not cover that," he added.

        <span id="midArticle_8">

         Under the merger plan laid out by Monsanto, Syngenta shareholders would retain a stake of about 30 percent of the combined group.
        </p>
        <span id="midArticle_9">
        </span>
        <p>
         In response, a Monsanto spokeswoman told Reuters the break-up fee would apply to any antitrust concerns, and referred to a June 6 letter sent by Monsanto to Syngenta's board of directors, which had been published by Syngenta.

         Monsanto wants to combine its world-leading seeds business with Syngenta's pesticides business, the largest in the industry. Syngenta has rejected the offer as too low and refused to open its books.

        <span id="midArticle_12">
        </span>
        <p>
         It has also argued that regulators would consider the merged group's combined market power in seeds and chemicals, because the two industries were gradually converging, as efforts by firms including Bayer (
         <span id="symbol_BAYGn.DE_2">
          BAYGn.DE

         ), Monsanto and Syngenta show.

         These companies are trying to become more efficient by developing seeds and pesticides in tandem and by developing sales and distribution strategies that integrate the two product categories.

        <span id="midArticle_14">
        </span>
        <p>
         Monsanto has argued that after the proposed sale of Syngenta's seeds business and some overlapping herbicides operations, regulators would not find any loss in head-to-head competition with its rivals.
        </p>
        <span id="midArticle_15">

         Syngenta has embarked on a number of meetings with analysts and investors after reporting better-than-expected first-half earnings on Thursday last week.

         At the time, it also reaffirmed its profitability targets, viewed as ambitious by some analysts, and highlighted the potential of new products in development, as it continued to argue its case for a strong future alone.
